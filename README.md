# BlockRaise

BlockRaise is a crowdfunding web application based on blockchain technology, specifically the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create campaigns and raise funds for their projects using cryptocurrency transactions. The project utilizes smart contracts written in Solidity and leverages the Hardhat framework for configuration and deployment. The Sepolia testnet is used for testing and experimentation purposes.

## Features

- Create and manage crowdfunding campaigns
- Accept donations and contributions in cryptocurrency
- Transparent and immutable transaction history
- Frontend developed using React.js
- Smart contract development using Solidity

## Getting Started
